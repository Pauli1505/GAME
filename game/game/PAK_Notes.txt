This pak file contains my attempt at making an HD retexture
of Quake 3 Arena's weapons. Motivated to make this since I've
seen that most either covered the whole thing in "shine"
shaders, or made a retexture that deviates way too far 
from the original weapon's texture design and color schemes.

My attempt's goal is to simply make a skin that's pleasing to
look at in an 8x anisotropic on a 720p scale resolution.

Went out and gone overboard with adding decals and more colors
to the weapons.

Also, made my own machinegun sound because i'm
sick and tired of hearing it's peashooter-y sound effect. Now it
sounds more powerful than it should be! XD

GL's color accents changed to green.
			-CZ45 [07/05/2016]

------------------------------------------------------------------
Incorporated "Quake III Arena Arcade" weapon models.
			-CZ45 [06/28/2017]
------------------------------------------------------------------
Remade all but two(SG & GL) of the weapon textures.
			-CZ45 [03/31/2019]
------------------------------------------------------------------

remade the shotgun texture.

MAJOR UPDATE
Effin' remade most weapon models and textures from scratch. Now it
looks great on a 1080p resolution with 16x anisotropic texture
filter. Also, true-3D muzzleflashes. Gauntlet and BFG in progress...
			-CZ45 [11/13/2022]
------------------------------------------------------------------
Gauntlet and BFG models done. Reworked textures for the rest, like
improved shades and removed decals(cleanup). Plasmagun model,
tweaked a bit. Reworked some hand anims. Opted on using
jpeg format for alot of the textures, for space and loading
optimization. And finally, separated weapon sounds as a separate
PAK file.
